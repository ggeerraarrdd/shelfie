### Future Work

No ongoing development.

* ~~Clean up code~~ _(Update May 28, 2023: Code too unwieldy, so leaving Tkinter version behind and moving on to the web version from scratch.)_
* ~~Create a web version using a web framework (Flask or Django)~~ _(Update Oct 14, 2023: Github does not need another book management system repo)_
